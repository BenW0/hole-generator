This script reproduces the parametric model used to create the training dataset for the paper,

Balu, Aditya, et al. "A Deep 3D Convolutional Neural Network Based Design for Manufacturability Framework." arXiv preprint arXiv:1612.02141 (2016).

The OpenSCAD file (model.scad) defines the geometry, and the python file (example.py) shows how to call OpenSCAD from the command line to automatically generate models.
